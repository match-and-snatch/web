        h2 What type of people or groups use ConnectPal?
        p
          'ConnectPal is for any person or group that produces content and has an audience.  A ConnectPal profile is like a profile page on any social network, but with a distinction, there is a charge for people to see your profile content.  ConnectPal empowers people to make money from their content in a simple way with no startup costs.  It takes 30 seconds to setup a profile on ConnectPal, and it is free to setup.  You can create a profile by going to the front page of ConnectPal.com, and then click on the red button "I want to create my own profile to start getting subscribers."

        h2 How does the pricing model work? Can you explain the ConnectPal service fee?
        p
          'Sure, of course we can explain!  At ConnectPal, if you setup a profile, there are no startup fees or hosting fees.  And you can cancel anytime. You can also set your profile on "Away Mode" at anytime if you want to take a long vacation.  During "Away Mode," your subscribers will not get billed.  Profile owners set their monthly subscription price, and the profile owner keeps 100% of the price they set.  ConnectPal adds a service fee on top of the subscription price to pay for credit card processing and to keep our platform running at its best.  The pricing table is below... for example, if a profile owner sets a monthly price of $4 for subscribers, then at checkout, subscribers will pay $4.99 monthly – the Profile Owner will keep $4 per active subscriber, and ConnectPal will get the 99 cent service fee.

        h2 How can I market my ConnectPal profile to get more subscribers?
        p
          'The best way to market your profile is to copy and paste your ConnectPal Profile link on the social media platforms that you use (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, SnapChat, Periscope, etc.). For example, if your ConnectPal Profile name is Bob Smith, and your ConnectPal Profile link is www.connectpal.com/bobsmith - then you can copy and paste that ConnectPal link in your Instagram Biography. Or, you can share your ConnectPal Profile link on Facebook and/or Twitter. When your potential subscribers click on the ConnectPal Profile link, they will automatically be routed to your Welcome Page where they can watch your Welcome Video and subscribe to you (which is explained in the next FAQ Question below).

        h2
          'Can I offer my potential subscribers a free trial of my profile content to entice them to subscribe? What is the 'Welcome Video"?
        p
          'As of now, we do not offer a free trial option, but we might add this feature in the near future.  However, there is a great feature to entice potential subscribers – it is called the 'Welcome Video.'  The 'Welcome Video' is a video that potential subscribers can see before they decide to subscribe to you.  On a mobile phone or table device, you can add the 'Welcome Video' by clicking on 'Edit Profile Details' and then click on "Update Welcome Video." If you are on a desktop or laptop, you can add the 'Welcome Video" by hitting the big green button that says '+ Welcome Media' on your profile page – this green button is located below the price on your profile page.  Your potential subscribers will be able to watch the Welcome Video before they subscribe, so please let them know why they should subscribe to you! And please keep your Welcome Video short and sweet, less than 30 seconds is great!

To engage 'Away Mode' on a mobile phone or tablet device, click on "Edit Profile Details" and then "Away Mode." If you are on a desktop or laptop computer, you can click on "My Account" - then click on "Profile Details."
