        h2 What type of people or groups use ConnectPal?
        p
          'ConnectPal is for any person, group, or business that produces content and has an audience. &nbsp;ConnectPal empowers people to make money from their content in a simple way with no startup costs. &nbsp;It takes 60 seconds to setup a profile on ConnectPal, and it is free to setup. &nbsp;You can create a profile by going to our homepage and clicking on the red button "I want to create my own profile to start getting subscribers". &nbsp;A ConnectPal profile is like a profile page on any social network, but with a distinction, there is a charge for people to see your profile content. &nbsp;You pick your own monthly price for fans to view your content. &nbsp;All you do is create stuff and tell your fans and followers – then we do the rest, and we send you a check!

        h2 How does the pricing model work? Can you explain the ConnectPal service fee?
        p
          'Sure, of course we can explain! &nbsp;At ConnectPal, if you setup a profile, there are no startup fees or hosting fees. &nbsp;And you can cancel anytime. &nbsp;You can also set your profile on "away mode" at anytime if you want to take a long vacation. &nbsp;During "away mode", your subscribers will not get billed. &nbsp;Profile owners set their monthly subscription price and the profile owners keep 100% of the price they set. &nbsp;ConnectPal adds a service fee on top of the subscription price to pay for credit card processing and to keep our platform running at its best. &nbsp;The pricing table is below... for example, if a profile owner sets a monthly price of $3 for subscribers, then at checkout, subscribers will pay $3.79 monthly – the Profile Owner will keep $3 for every subscriber, and ConnectPal will get the 79 cent service fee.

        h2 As a profile owner, how and when do I get paid?
        p
          'Ah, the good part! &nbsp;Time to get paid! &nbsp;A profile owner gets paid on the 1st of every month, and your money will appear on your bank statement within 7 days after the 1st of the month. &nbsp;A profile owner must earn a minimum of $100 before they can get paid out. &nbsp;A profile owner must set up a valid bank account to get paid. &nbsp;Also, once a profile owner earns more than $400 in any given year, ConnectPal will send you a 1099 for tax purposes... the IRS is tough! &nbsp;If you want to change your banking or payment details at anytime, just click on "My Account" and then click on "Payout Information".
