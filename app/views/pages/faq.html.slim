        h2 What type of people or groups use ConnectPal?
        p ConnectPal is for any person or group that produces content and has an audience. A ConnectPal profile is like a profile page on any social network, but with a distinction, there is a charge for people to see your profile content. ConnectPal empowers people to make money from their content in a simple way with no startup costs. It takes less than 55 seconds to setup a profile on ConnectPal, and it is free to setup. You can create a profile by going to the front page of ConnectPal.com, and then click on the red button "I want to create my own profile to start getting subscribers".

        h2 As a profile owner, can I cancel my account anytime I want?
        p Yes, of course! At ConnectPal, if you are a profile owner, you can cancel anytime. You just go to "My Account" on a desktop/laptop computer, and then click on Profile Details". For Security Purposes, we currently do not allow account deletion on mobile phones.

      .well
        h2 How can I market my ConnectPal profile to get more subscribers?
        p The best way to market your profile is to copy and paste your ConnectPal Profile link on the social media platforms that you use (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, SnapChat, Periscope, etc.). For example, if your ConnectPal Profile name is Bob Smith, and your ConnectPal Profile link is www.connectpal.com/bobsmith - then you can copy and paste that ConnectPal link in your Instagram Biography. Or, you can share your ConnectPal Profile link on Facebook and/or Twitter. When your potential subscribers click on the ConnectPal Profile link, they will automatically be routed to your Welcome Page where they can watch your Welcome Video and subscribe to you (which is explained in the next FAQ Question below).

      .well
        h2 Can I offer my potential subscribers a free trial of my profile content to entice them to subscribe? What is the "Welcome Video"?
        p As of now, we do not offer a free trial option, but we might add this feature in the near future. However, there is a great feature to entice potential subscribers – it is called the "Welcome Video". The "Welcome Video" is a video that potential subscribers can see before they decide to subscribe to you. On a mobile phone or table device, you can add the "Welcome Video" by clicking on "Edit Profile Details" and then click on "Update Welcome Video". If you are on a desktop or laptop, you can add the "Welcome Video" by hitting the big green button that says "+ Welcome Media" on your profile page – this green button is located below the price on your profile page. Your potential subscribers will be able to watch the Welcome Video before they subscribe, so please let them know why they should subscribe to you! And please keep your Welcome Video short and sweet, less than 30 seconds is great!

        h2 As a profile owner, how and when do I get paid?
        p
          | Ah, the good part!  For profile owners that qualify for a payout, ConnectPal will send you an email within 2-3 business days after the last day of the calendar month.  Please see our "
          a href=pricing_path Pricing Breakdown
          | " for an explanation of pricing and payment.  Your money will appear on your bank statement within 7 days after you receive your email.  A profile owner must earn a $200 Minimum or more in a calendar month before they can get paid out. Also, once a profile owner earns more than $20,000 in a calendar year, ConnectPal will send you a 1099 for tax purposes. If you want to change your banking or payment details at anytime, you can do so on a mobile phone, tablet device, or a desktop/laptop computer.

            span If a profile owner generates more than $200 in a calendar month from active subscribers as measured on the last day of the calendar month, then that profile owner will have met the $200 minimum threshold. &nbsp;If a profile owner meets or exceeds the $200 minimum threshold, then all hosting fees will be waived. &nbsp;So, there are no hosting fees whatsoever for a profile that exceeds the $200 minimum threshold. &nbsp;However, any profile that generates less than the $200 minimum threshold from active subscribers as measured on the last day of the calendar month shall be subject to a hosting fee of $200 per month. &nbsp;The $200 hosting fee will be deducted from the profile’s earnings (if any) at the end of the month. &nbsp;Any profile with a negative hosting fee balance may be locked and/or deleted. &nbsp;Once a profile is locked and/or deleted, ConnectPal agrees to cancel any and all hosting fees and hosting fee debt.
