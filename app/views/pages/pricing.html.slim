      h1 Pricing Breakdown
      p At ConnectPal, there are no startup fees or hosting fees!... And you can cancel anytime.

      p Any person or group can set up a profile and become a profile owner for free.

      p Profile owners set their monthly subscription price for subscribers to view their profile content. Profile owners keep 100% of the price they set. Then, ConnectPal adds a service fee on top of the subscription price to pay for credit card processing and to keep our platform running at its best.

      p The pricing table is below...

            b ConnectPal Service Fee

          td $5 or less
          td $0.99
        tr
          td $6 - $20
          td $1.99
        tr
          td $21 & above
          td 9% of subscription price

      p For example, if a profile owner sets a monthly fee of $4 for subscribers, then at checkout, subscribers will pay $4.99 monthly â€“ which includes our 99 cent service fee. The profile owner will receive $4 per subscriber per month. And ConnectPal will receive 99 cents per subscriber per month.
