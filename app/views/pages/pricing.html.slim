      h1 Pricing Breakdown
      p At ConnectPal, any person or group can setup a profile for free.  There are no startup fees or hosting fees!
      p And you can cancel anytime.
      p Profile owners set their monthly subscription price for subscribers to view their profile content.  Profile owners keep 100% of the price they set.  Then, ConnectPal adds a service fee on top of the subscription price to pay for credit card processing and to keep our platform running at its best.
      p The pricing table is below.
