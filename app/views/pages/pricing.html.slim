      h1 Pricing Breakdown
      p At ConnectPal, any person or group can setup a profile for free.
      p And you can cancel anytime.
      p Profile owners set their monthly subscription price for subscribers to view their profile content.  Profile owners keep 100% of the price they set.  Then, ConnectPal adds a service fee on top of the subscription price to pay for credit card processing and to keep our platform running at its best.
      p The pricing table is below.

      p For example, if a profile owner sets a monthly fee of $4 for subscribers, then at checkout, subscribers will pay $4.99 per month â€“ which includes our 99 cent service fee.  The profile owner will receive $4 per active subscriber per month.  And ConnectPal will receive 99 cents per subscriber per month.
