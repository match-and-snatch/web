      h1 Terms of Use

      h2 Agreement Of Use:

      p Hi there, and thank you for taking the time to read our terms and conditions. Let's begin.

      p By using or visiting the website and entity ConnectPal (furthermore referred to as the “Site”), or any of its products, software, data feeds, and services you signify your agreement to the following terms and conditions known as the "Terms of Service".

      h2 Usage Of Service:

      p Usage of the Site applies to all registered users, visitors, and content contributors using the service.

      p It is important to note that the Site may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by the Site. The Site retains no authority or control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, the Site will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. Usage of the Site expressly relieves ConnectPal along with any and all associated officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees from all claims, demands and damages, both actual and consequential, of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected from any and all potential liabilities arising from the use of any third-party website.

By accepting this Terms Of Service, you affirm, warrant, and represent that you retain or have been granted the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to publish Content you submit. Your acceptance of this Terms Of Service also grants license to ConnectPal all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to such Content for publication and dissemination on the Service pursuant to these Terms of Service.

      p ConnectPal reserves the right to decide whether posted content violates these Terms of Service. Prohibited items and activities include, but are not limited to, engaging in copyright infringement, posting or promoting pornographic materials, promoting illegal activies or unlawful actions, promotion or sale of controlled substances and pharmaceuticals, the impersonation or misrepresentation of any individiual or entity, and currency exchange between parties

      h2 Copyright Infringement and claims thereof:

      p
        ' If you believe your work has been copied in a way that constitutes infringement on the Site or via the Service offered through the Site, as set forth in the Digital Millenium Copyright Act of 1998 you are required to provide the following information to
        a href="mailto:help@connectpal.com" help@connectpal.com
        '.

      ol
        li an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;
        li a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
        li a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the site;
        li your address, telephone number, and email address;
        li a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
        li a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf.

      p Once ConnectPal receives your notice, it will thoroughly investigate the matter and respond to you with its results, in no event no later than 30 days after receipt of notice. ConnectPal may remove the content related to a particular claim if the claim proves to be substantiated. An infringing account may be terminated for violation of these Terms Of Service.

      h2 Pricing and Payment:

      p
        |The Site reserves all rights to modify and adjust any pricing at it's sole discretion, and will update the pricing schedule online (
        a href=pricing_path here
        |) a minimum of 10 days before any pricing modification. A price schedule can be found (
        a href=pricing_path here
        |). The Site reserves all rights to change pricing structures and impose fees on any account type, whether it is an owner account that sells content, or a subscriber account that buys.

      p Users who have earned revenue through their respective pages will be paid through an ACH transfer once they surpass a 100 US Dollar minimum. Users who surpass a 400 dollar payout threshold ($400) will be required to fill out and submit a W-9 tax form. Users may receive a 1099 tax form from the Site if they surpass a certain monetary threshold. Everyone's tax liabilities will differ and users are expected to conduct their own due diligence and file accordingly based upon income derived from the Site. Users are responsible to collect their own sales tax (if applicable). The Site assumes no responsibility for any individual tax liability based upon a users income. ConnectPal reserves the right to withhold a minimum of 28% of a users income, or terminate a user account if they fail to complete the W-9 tax form or other requests mandated by the Site.

      p A transaction can result in a chargeback due to dispute, suspicion of fraud or other purposes. The Site reserves the right to withdraw from a users account the amount of a transaction due to the belief that there is a significantly increased risk of a chargeback occurring. If a users account is pending resolution of any chargebacks, the Site reserves all rights to suspend payment on the user account until the subsequent pay period.

      p The Site reserves and maintains the right to offer a free trial of any profile to any potential subscriber on a non-reccuring trial basis of no longer than 30 days in length.

      p If cancellation occurs during the course of a billing cycle, fees incurred from that cycle shall be non-refundable. For example purposes only, if a user subscribes on March 2nd, and cancels their subscription on March 2nd, or any point until the following billing cycle date, payment shall be non-refundable. The monthly payment from a subscriber in the billing cycle directly preceding cancellation shall be held by ConnectPal to deal with any potential customer issues. ConnectPal reserves the right in its sole discretion to retain and keep the monthly payment from subscribers in the billing cycle directly preceding cancellation regardless of whether or not a customer issue emerges. If a customer issue does emerge, ConnectPal reserves the right in its sole discretion to deal with the issue in a manner that is decided solely by ConnectPal. If no customer issue emerges, ConnectPal reserves the right to retain and keep the monthly payment from subscribers in the billing cycle directly preceding cancellation at its sole discretion.

      p If a ConnectPal account owner sets up a profile and has more than 10 paying subscribers, yet the account owner does not deliver on any of the subscriber benefits listed within 10 days of creating the account, then ConnectPal reserves the right in its sole discretion to cancel the account and/or retain and keep all payments to the account. If an account has 21 days of inactivity and/or no active posting, and the account owner does not place the account on away mode, then ConnectPal reserves the right in its sole discretion to cancel the account and/or retain and keep all payments to the account. If a ConnectPal account owner creates an account that fails to generate more than $100 in total subscription sales within 30 days of the opening of the account, ConnectPal reserves the right in its sole discretion to shut down the account, and keep all payments associated with the account.

      p Upon deletion of a profile or the implied intent to no longer provide content on ConnectPal, ConnectPal will keep all payments in the final month of the account. For example, if a profile is cancelled on May 8th, all earnings from May 1st-8th will become the property of ConnectPal to be used for potential refunds.  Using our previous example of a May 8th cancellation, the Profile Owner's final payment will be for the month of April, and it will be paid out at the beginning of May.  All payments in May will be the property of ConnectPal.  ConnectPal will issue refunds to subscribers at its sole discretion.  If ConnectPal decides to issue no refunds whatsoever, the money generated in the final month shall be the property of ConnectPal.

      h2 Account Usage:

      p When creating your account, it is required that you provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. If your account is breached or compromised, you must inform the Site immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Under no circumstances are you allowed to use another users account without permission.’

      p ConnectPal reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright infringement. The Site may at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user's account for submitting such material in violation of these Terms of Service.

      p Users who maintain owner accounts are able to place their accounts on away mode. Away mode is a voluntary option, and all subscribers to the specific account will be notified.

      p ConnectPal does not transfer or provide any personal information of its subscribers or profile owners to 3rd parties or to other subscribers or profile owners.  ConnectPal will not share email addresses of subscribers and/or profile owners, and ConnectPal will not share or distribute financial information of subscribers and/or profile owners.  Any request by a profile owner or 3rd party for such subscriber information, or for a transfer of such information, will be denied.

      p ConnectPal is not responsible for any promises, subscriber benefits, statements, or claims made by any Profile Owner.  ConnectPal shall not be held liable for any claims, promises, or misrepresentations made by profile owners.  Subscribers have the option to cancel at anytime by clicking on “Billing Information” in their account.  If a subscriber is unsatisfied for any reason, subscribers must cancel on their own volition, as ConnectPal will not proactively issue cancellations on the subscribers behalf.
