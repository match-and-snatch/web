          span If a profile owner generates more than $200 in a calendar month from active subscribers as measured on the last day of the calendar month, then that profile owner will have met the $200 minimum threshold. &nbsp;If a profile owner meets or exceeds the $200 minimum threshold, then all hosting fees will be waived. &nbsp;So, there are no hosting fees whatsoever for a profile that exceeds the $200 minimum threshold. &nbsp;However, any profile that generates less than the $200 minimum threshold from active subscribers as measured on the last day of the calendar month shall be subject to a hosting fee of $200 per month. &nbsp;The $200 hosting fee will be deducted from the profile’s earnings (if any) at the end of the month. &nbsp;Any profile with a negative hosting fee balance may be locked and/or deleted. &nbsp;Once a profile is locked and/or deleted, ConnectPal agrees to cancel any and all hosting fees and hosting fee debt.

  p For example, if a profile owner sets a monthly fee of $4 for subscribers, then at checkout, subscribers will pay $4.99 per month – which includes ConnectPal's 99 cent service fee. &nbsp;The profile owner will receive $4 per active subscriber per month. &nbsp;And ConnectPal will receive 99 cents per subscriber per month. The active subscriber number is measured on the last day of the calendar month, and profile owners get paid 2-3 business days after the last day of the calendar month.

    'Profile owners can also go on away mode. &nbsp;While your profile is in away mode, your subscribers will not be billed.  So, you can take a vacation whenever you want!
