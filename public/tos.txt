Moreover, ConnectPal reserves the right to cooperate fully in any investigation. In such instances, ConnectPal further reserves the right to immediately terminate without notice any account which ConnectPal believes, in ConnectPal’s sole discretion, is in violation of this Agreement.</p><h2>Pricing and Payment:</h2><p>The Site reserves all rights to modify and adjust any pricing at it's sole discretion, and will update the pricing schedule online (<a href="/pricing">here</a>) a minimum of 10 days before any pricing modification. A price schedule can be found (<a href="/pricing">here</a>). The Site reserves all rights to change pricing structures and impose fees on any account type, whether it is an owner account that sells content, or a subscriber account that buys. Refunds or credits will not be issued for partially used memberships, or partial month of service/membership.</p><p>Users who have earned revenue through their respective profile will be paid through an ACH transfer only if they surpass a 200 US Dollar minimum earned in a calendar month from active subscribers as measured at the end of a calendar month. If a user does not surpass $200 in earnings from active subscribers at the end of a calendar month, the Site reserves the right to terminate the account at its sole discretion, and the money in the account may be used for potential refunds and/or become the property of the Site – such determination will be made by the Site at its sole discretion. Users who surpass a 400 dollar payout threshold ($400) may be required to fill out and submit a W-9 tax form – the exact amount of earnings that will trigger a W-9 tax form request will be made by the Site in conjunction with the Site's tax experts. Users may receive a 1099 tax form from the Site if they surpass a certain monetary threshold. Everyone's tax liabilities will differ and users are expected to conduct their own due diligence and file accordingly based upon income derived from the Site. Users are responsible to collect their own sales tax (if applicable). The Site assumes no responsibility for any individual tax liability based upon a users income. ConnectPal reserves the right to withhold a minimum of 28% of a users income, or terminate a user account if they fail to complete the W–9 tax form or other requests mandated by the Site.</p><p>ConnectPal will pay all subscriber and contribution money to the Bank Account or PayPal Account on record with the profile account. ConnectPal is not responsible for any other 3rd party arrangements for distribution of income. If any disputes shall arise, ConnectPal is not responsible for money disputes and bears no financial responsibility, the responsibility for income distribution to other parties (if any) shall be the sole responsibility of the individual or groups in charge of the main Bank Account or PayPal Account on the profile account.</p><p>A transaction can result in a chargeback due to dispute, suspicion of fraud, or other purposes. The Site reserves the right to withdraw from the earnings of a profile in the event of any dispute, refund, and/or chargeback. The Site has full authorization to withdraw, in part or in full, the amount of a refund, dispute or chargeback, along with any associated fees or penalties incurred. The site may use the withdrawal amount at its discretion to ensure the Site does not suffer any financial loss related to any dispute, suspicion of fraud, or other purposes. If a users account is pending resolution of any chargebacks, the Site reserves all rights to suspend payment on the user account until the subsequent pay period or until such dispute is resolved.</p><p>The Site reserves and maintains the right to offer a free trial of any profile to any potential subscriber on a non-recurring trial basis of no longer than 30 days in length.</p><p>If cancellation occurs during the course of a billing cycle, fees incurred from that cycle shall be non-refundable. For example purposes only, if a user subscribes on March 2nd, and cancels their subscription on March 2nd, or any point until the following billing cycle date, payment shall be non-refundable. The monthly payment from a subscriber in the billing cycle directly preceding cancellation shall be held by ConnectPal to deal with any potential customer issues. ConnectPal reserves the right in its sole discretion to retain and keep the monthly payment from subscribers in the billing cycle directly preceding cancellation regardless of whether or not a customer issue emerges. If a customer issue does emerge, ConnectPal reserves the right in its sole discretion to deal with the issue in a manner that is decided solely by ConnectPal. If no customer issue emerges, ConnectPal reserves the right to retain and keep the monthly payment from subscribers in the billing cycle directly preceding cancellation at its sole discretion.</p><p>Subscribers will be billed monthly.  When a subscriber joins the Site initially, the Subscriber will be billed immediately upon entering the Site after the Subscriber has entered valid credit card information and the subscriber hits 'Pay and Subscribe'  The definition of 'monthly' will be billing at any point that is between 28 days to 31 days after the initial purchase of the subscription.  The Site reserves the right to set the recurring billing at any point that is 28 days to 31 days following the previous bill payment.</p><p>The Site reserves the right to cancel, lock, and/or delete a subscriber account at any time for any reason whatsoever. The Site reserves the right to cancel, lock, and/or delete a profile owner account at any time for any reason whatsoever. While the Site may inform you of the reason for cancellation, locking, and/or deleting your profile, it is under no obligation to inform.  If a ConnectPal account owner sets up a profile and has 5 or more paying subscribers, yet the account owner has not posted any audio or video content within 24 hours after receiving their 5th paying subscriber, then ConnectPal reserves the right in its sole discretion to cancel the account and/or retain and keep all payments to the account. If an account has 10 days of inactivity and/or no active posting, and the account owner does not place the account on away mode, then ConnectPal reserves the right in its sole discretion to lock and/or delete the account and retain/keep all payments to the account. If a ConnectPal account owner creates an account that fails to generate more than $200 in sales from active subscribers within 30 days of the opening of the account, ConnectPal reserves the right in its sole discretion to shut down the account, and keep all payments associated with the account. ConnectPal will not make a payout to a profile account owner unless that profile owner has completed at least 30 days in good standing, and the account must generate a minimum of $200 in sales from active subscribers as measured at the end of the calendar month for a payout to occur. ConnectPal reserves the right in its sole discretion to make a payout (if any) to a profile owner before the 30 day good standing period has ended. Regarding counting the final number of active subscribers in a calendar month, the Site will select the final active subscriber number at a point between the following 24-hour time period: 5pm-est on the final day of the calendar month and 5pm-est on the first day of the calendar month that directly follows the end of the previous calendar month in which the subscriber number is being tallied. The selection point during this 24-hour time frame will be at ConnectPal's sole discretion, and this number is not subject to audit.  Regarding monthly payouts, the profile owner must earn a minimum of $200 from active subscribers as measured at the end of a calendar month to receive a payout from the Site. This $200 from active subscribers must be earned within the calendar month. Earnings are closed out every month at the end of month. Every new month is its own accounting period, and there is no carry forward of earnings or rollover of earnings. The monthly payout (if any) shall encompass the total payout for the month, and the Site's monthly payouts are not subject to audit by subscribers and/or profile owners. Earnings do not accumulate month by month to meet the minimum $200 monthly threshold. For example, if a profile owner earns $50 in a calendar month, that $50 is below the $200 minimum threshold, so no payout will happen for that account. The $50 may be used by the Site to issue refunds to subscribers at the Site's sole discretion, and/or the money will become the property of the Site at its sole discretion. Moreover, this $50 cannot be used to rollover for the next month to qualify for the minimum payout threshold. That $50 will not count toward the $200 minimum, and that money (because it fell below the $200 minimum) will not be paid out. Using this same $50 example, if a profile owner earns $160 from active subscribers in the month that follows the $50 earnings, the profile owner still does not quality for a payout. The profile owner earned $160 which is below the $200 minimum threshold, and the $50 earned in the proceeding month to the $160 in earnings does not count toward the $200 minimum. So even though $210 was earned in aggregate over 2 months, the profile owner failed to meet the $200 minimum in a calendar month so no payout will be issued in either of the 2 months as explained in this example. If a profile owner earns $50 in a calendar month, and then the next month he or she earns $210 in a calendar month from active subscribers, then the profile owner will receive $210 for the monthly payout because that is above the $200 threshold – but not $260 because the $50 in earnings in the prior month does not carry forward and does not rollover.</p><p>Upon deletion of a profile or the implied intent to no longer provide content on ConnectPal, ConnectPal will keep all payments in the final 30 days of the account. Similarly, for any payments to be issued from ConnectPal, the Site and/or its users must complete an entire calendar month.  If for any reason a complete calendar month cannot be completed by the Site or the user, such payments shall be forfeited and will remain the property of the Site.  In accessing the Site you affirm and agree that you have read and understood the foregoing.</p><p>In its sole discretion, ConnectPal may lock, delete, disable access to, or terminate accounts which are the subject of three (3) or more credit card chargebacks/disputes in any ninety (90) day period.  In its sole discretion, ConnectPal may lock, delete, disable access to, or terminate accounts that have less than 30 active subscribers and have been the subject of one or more credit card chargeback/disputes.  While the Site may inform you of the reason for cancellation, locking, and/or deleting your profile, it is under no obligation to inform.  Site reserves the right to retain all revenue generated by the account in question in the last thirty (30) days before the account termination to settle any and all liabilities.  Such monies will be utilized by the Site at the sole discretion of ConnectPal.  Any monies leftover after the settlement of liabilities will be up to the Site at its sole discretion and may become the property of the Site at its sole discretion.  Moreover, should an account be the subject of an excessive number of credit card chargebacks/disputes, ConnectPal reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to issue a “dispute fee(s)” for excessive credit card chargebacks/disputes of up to $30.00 per each individual credit card chargeback/dispute – the amount of the "dispute fee(s)" will be at the sole discretion of ConnectPal, but it shall never exceed $30.00 per each individual credit card chargeback/dispute.  For clarity regarding the ‘dispute fee’ regarding excessive chargebacks/disputes, ConnectPal considers the term “excessive” to be more than 3 chargebacks/disputes in any 30-day period, and/or 6 chargebacks/disputes in any 90–day period.  The ‘dispute fee(s)’ will be in addition to any bank charges that also apply for credit card chargebacks/disputes.  Regarding credit card chargebacks/disputes, both the dispute fees and bank charges are not subject to audit.  In accessing the Site you affirm and agree that have read and understood the foregoing.</p><p>All profile owners must enter in their banking information into the Payout Information section of their account to get paid by ConnectPal, that is, only if the profile owner qualifies for a payout under the Site’s Terms of Service.  If the profile owner does qualify for a payout, the profile owner must enter in their banking information details under the section “Payout Information.”  A profile owner has up to 7 days after the 1st of the month to enter in their payout information to receive the payout from the previous month’s activity.  So, by the 8th day of the month, the profile owner must enter in their payout information to receive their payout from the previous month’s activity.  If by the 9th day of the month or at any point after that, the profile owner still has not entered in the banking information into Payout Information, then the previous month’s payout shall be forfeited in its entirety, and the money will become the property of the Site.  For international clients (outside the USA) only, the Site may elect to pay the profile owner via PayPal.  International clients must contact the Site at either <a href="mailto:business@connectpal.com">business@connectpal.com</a> or <a href="mailto:help@connectpal.com">help@connectpal.com</a> by the 8th day of the month or sooner to quality for the previous month’s payout.  If by the 9th day of the month or at any point after that, the International profile owner still has not contacted the Site in regards to Payout Information, then the previous month’s payout shall be forfeited in its entirety, and the money will become the property of the Site.  If the profile owner qualifies for a payout as discussed in the Terms of Service, the Site will transfer money to the bank account on record through ACH deposit for USA domestic transfers, and/or PayPal or other 3rd party transfer service for International Transfers.  If the transfer is international, then the profile owner’s money transfer may be subject to financial transfer fees.  If the Site transfers the money to the account on file, and the banking institution, PayPal, and/or 3rd party transfer service keeps the money and/or refuses to remit the money to the profile owner, the Site is not responsible for this lack of payment.  Once the Site attempts to transfer the money via ACH transfer, PayPal, and/or 3rd party transfer service, the Site has upheld its responsibility and is not liable for any losses of money or fees relating to any payment problems.  It is the sole responsibility of the profile owner to ensure that the profile owner is able to accept transfer funds from the Site. </p><p>Upon request, a profile owner is required to provide a state drivers license and/or passport to the Site.  If asked by the Site for this identification which may be asked for by the Site for any reason, the profile owner must respond within 72 hours with such verification.  If verification is not provided within 72 hours, then the profile account may be locked and/or deleted, and all money in the account will become the property of the Site.</p><p>Once an account has been locked, deleted, or terminated in any way by the Site, the individual responsible for that account is prohibited from creating or establishing a new account in any capacity on the Site.  The account holder is similarly barred from utilizing any other name, moniker, or mark to establish a new account on the Site.  If ConnectPal discovers account creation contrary to this clause and these Terms, it may immediately terminate said account without any prior notice.  ConnectPal may, in its sole discretion, prosecute any violations of this clause to the fullest extent of the law.</p><h2>Account Usage:</h2><p>When creating your account, it is required that you provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. If your account is breached or compromised, you must inform the Site immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Under no circumstances are you allowed to use another users account without permission.</p><p>ConnectPal reserves the right to decide whether Content violates these Terms of Service for reasons other than copyright infringement. The Site may at any time, without prior notice and in its sole discretion, remove such Content and/or terminate a user's account for submitting such material in violation of these Terms of Service.</p><p>Users who maintain owner accounts are able to place their accounts on away mode. Away mode is a voluntary option, and all subscribers to the specific account will be notified.</p><p>ConnectPal does not transfer or provide any personal information of its subscribers or profile owners to 3rd parties or to other subscribers or profile owners. ConnectPal will not share email addresses of subscribers and/or profile owners, and ConnectPal will not share or distribute financial information of subscribers and/or profile owners. Any request by a profile owner or 3rd party for such subscriber information, or for a transfer of such information, will be denied.</p><p>ConnectPal reserves the right to issue promotional materials using the name and/or image of any profile owner and/or profile. Promotional Materials may include, but are not limited to, press releases, banner advertising, and usage of images and likeness of profile owners and/or profiles.</p><p>ConnectPal is not responsible for any promises, subscriber benefits, statements, or claims made by any Profile Owner. ConnectPal shall not be held liable for any claims, promises, or misrepresentations made by profile owners. Subscribers have the option to cancel at anytime by clicking on “Billing Information” in their account. If a subscriber is unsatisfied for any reason, subscribers must cancel on their own volition, as ConnectPal will not proactively issue cancellations on the subscribers behalf.</p><p>Content and other services and information presented by any Profile Owner through the Service are for educational purposes only and is in no way intended to diagnose, cure, or treat any medical or other health condition. The Service, including any Content therein, does not constitute medical advice and is not intended to be and should not be used in place of the advice of your physician. Before starting any diet and/or fitness program through the Service, consult your physician to determine if such program is right for your needs. Do not start a diet and/or fitness program through the Service if your physician or healthcare provider advises against it.</p><p>The Site may not be used as a payment processor to facilitate content sales and/or distribution on a 3rd party platform and/or application that is not owned by the Site. For example, the attempt to sell a password, or the selling of participation in a private account on a 3rd party application in exchange for payment on ConnectPal is forbidden. Any attempt to engage in selling access to a 3rd party application by using ConnectPal as a payment processor will not be tolerated, and such activity will result in the termination of the account and the forfeiture of all money in the account. The money in the violated account will be used at the sole discretion of ConnectPal, and may become the property of ConnectPal at its sole discretion.</p><h2>Content Submissions</h2><p>As part of the services offered, the Site permits the submission of video and other communications, as well as the posting, hosting, sharing, and publishing of those submissions.
